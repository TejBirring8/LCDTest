# LCDTest
A modular C++ application designed to test LCD displays on Linux-kernel-based embedded platforms via the FBDEV interface.

Since tests are defined in using a modular abstraction provided by the source code, a single "build" may implement multiple tests for multiple devices (e.g. platform or product variants).

Designed with minimal runtime dependencies in mind.
